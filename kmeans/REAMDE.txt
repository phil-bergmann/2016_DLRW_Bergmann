Depends on content of ../data and the whole content of this folder

Problem 30:
kmeans.py

Problem 31:
run kmeans.py
The 'repflds.png' File will be created.

Bonus Question 1:
minibatch_kmeans.py
Tried to implement it but somehow didn't get it right. Think my theano functions are somewhat buggy.
Image is written to 'cifar_minibatch.png'.

Note: Tried to improve it but it still only produces crap...

Note2: New try to implement minibatch k-Means: minibatch_kmeans2.py
This time the old structure from kmeans.py was used and only a damping was introduced in step 3 of the paper where
D = X * S_T + damping*D to make the influence of one minibatch smaller on the overall result D. This factor can be adapted
in the function parameters. At the moment it is set to dataset_size / batch_size (50000/500 = 100) which makes sense for me.
The result is plotted to 'cifar_minibatch2.png'.
To test just run minibatch_kmeans2.py.

Bonus Question 2:
